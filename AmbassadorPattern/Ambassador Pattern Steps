Ambassador Pattern Steps:

1. I have used "dbit/ubuntu-docker-fig" image to setup two host machines with docker compose
	
	vagrant init dbit/ubuntu-docker-fig

2. Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine using a IP Address: 192.168.33.10
	- Uncomment "config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10" in Vagrantfile of host machine 1.

3. Start both machines using :
	
	vagrant up

4. ssh into Host Machine 1 and run docker-compose.yml to start the redis-server and redis ambassador image.

- Redis ambassador is linked to redis server through port 6379:6379 mapping.

	sudo docker-compose up -d

5. ssh into Host Machine 2 and run docker-compose.yml to start the redis-client and redis ambassador
- On Host2 we run redis-client which will automatically run redis-ambassador in this host2 with following command:

	sudo docker-compose run redis_client

6. Set the key on redis client:

	set mykey "Hello World"

7. Retrieve the key from redis-server

	get mykey

	Done.
